## Hi there 👋

🌟 ┃ Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a 17-year-old sixth form student currently studying A-Level Computer Science, IT, and Business. With a deep interest in technology, I’m especially passionate about software development, engineering, and cybersecurity.

💻 ┃ What I'm Into

🧠 ┃ I spend most of my time exploring the world of software engineering—whether that's building projects with JavaScript and Python or experimenting with new technologies that push my understanding further. I love turning ideas into functional, user-friendly tools that solve real problems.

🔐 ┃ I’m also diving into the fundamentals of cybersecurity—learning how systems are protected (and exploited), and developing a strong foundation in secure coding practices.
