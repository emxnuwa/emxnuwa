## Hi there 👋

🌟 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a 17-year-old sixth form student currently studying A-Level Computer Science, IT, and Business. With a deep interest in technology, I’m especially passionate about software development, engineering, and cybersecurity.

💻 What I'm Into

🧠 I spend most of my time exploring the world of software engineering—whether that's building projects with JavaScript and Python or experimenting with new technologies that push my understanding further. I love turning ideas into functional, user-friendly tools that solve real problems.

🔐 I’m also diving into the fundamentals of cybersecurity—learning how systems are protected (and exploited), and developing a strong foundation in secure coding practices.

🌐 My Tech Stack & Skills

    Python
    JavaScript (vanilla + frameworks)
    HTML / CSS
    Responsive Web Design
    Website Performance Optimization
    Cybersecurity Fundamentals

🚀 Always learning, always building. Whether it's a browser-based tool, a script to automate something cool, or a concept I'm trying to master—I’m here to grow, collaborate, and contribute.
